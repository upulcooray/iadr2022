:::

::: {.f-30 .absolute top="20%"}
-   Data from 2013-2014, 2015-2016, and 2017-2018 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey(NHANES)

-   Dentate (edentulous individuals were excluded)

-   Age 21 to 70

-   **N= 8840**

-   Missing data were imputed using random forest multiple imputation generating 10 datasets
:::

::: notes
We used data from 3 NHANES cycles from 2013 to 2018

edentulous individuals were excluded as our outcome is dental pain

and we restricted the study population include only adults

Our final analitical sample was 8840

and the missing data were imputed using rf multiple imputation generating 10 data sets

### Exposure {.f-30 .li-m}

**üíµ Poverty Income Ratio (PIR)**

-   `Family income`/ `poverty threshold`

-   Continuous variable (Range 0-5)

-   **PIR \< 1** : In poverty

-   median PIR : Threshold for the relative poverty

-   People with \> 5 PIR are lumped together in the data

### Outcome {.li-m .f-30}

**üòß Frequent dental pain**

-   Categories: [Very often/ Fairly often/]{.bg-r} [Occasionally/ Hardly ever/ Never]{.bg-g}

-   Dichotomised : \[Very often/ Fairly often\] = 1

### Covariates {.f-30 .li-m}

-   Age, Sex, Education, Ethnicity

-   Marital status, household size

-   Number of teeth, Number of carious teeth

::: {.absolute .fragment top="20%" right="-5%"}
![](img/dag-2.png)
:::
:::

::: notes
Poverty income ratio was the exposure

Which is calculated by dividing household income by poverty threshold for the particular year

This is a continuous variable ranging from 0 to 5

and there are couple of important thresholds associates with PIR

PIR = 1 is the threshold for absolute poverty

and the median value of the PIR is considered the threshold for relative poverty

In NhanES for some reason all the participants who has PIR of 5 or more are lumped toghther in the data.

therefore we exculded PIR=5 participants to obtain a normal looking exposure.

\[go to outcome tab\]

The outcome was frequent dental pain,

we derived a binary variable by grouping individuals who experienced dental pain fairly often or more

\[go to cova tab\]

We adjusted for variety of covaritates. Estimates I present here are adjusted for number of remaining teeth and number of carious teeth teeth as well..

but We might remove them later because i feel like these are more of mediators

I think majority of attendees today joined efiforum as well.. So I will go through statistical analysis part bit quicker

It was consist of three main steps

first defining the causal effect by shifting the observed exposure

second estimation of expected outcome using TMLE under shifted exposure

finallly, contrasting outcome estiamtes to shifted exposure against outcome estimate with observed exposure

::: notes
In this study we designed targeted interventions at two different levels

first we improved the poverty income ratio only among participants who were below absolute poverty threshold

we implemented screnarios where they increase the PIR by 25% the 50%, 75% , and finally doubled the PIR. all these intervention were upper bounded by absolute poverty threshold

meaning \[zoom\]

for example, this individuals observed PIR is point 78 , eventhough we are doubling the PIR in this intervention this person will improve only upto pir = 1

Then we did the same for the below relative poverty line participants

THe median pir  of our sample was 1.7

THis is how the results looked like

Interventions only among those in absolute poverty did not have a significant effect on the observed level of frequent dental pain prevalence.

However, intervention on reducing relative poverty showed a significant reduction in the likelihood of frequent dental pain in the study population.

all these estimates were covariate adjusted ,

weighted for NHANES svy design 

and cross validated using 10 folds

estimates from imputed data sets were combined using rubins rules

::: notes
I wanted to understand the intervention only among absolute poor did not work

so I just simply count the outcome at each PIR value and ploted them

This suggests that even though the proportion of frequent dental pain is higher among absolute poor.

When we look at the whole study population majority contribution towards prevalence pool is coming from the individuals who are not at absolute poverty (Simple because their are the majority).

Therefore, intervening only among absolute poor did not translate into population level improvement

I think this phenomenon is similar for most oral health outcomes

Therfore, I think it is very important to consider this in policy implementations

## [Conclusions]{.lrb-b .bg-r .green .cen}

<br/>

üéØ Poverty act as a high level cause of frequent dental pain among US adults

üéØ Interventions to reduce relative poverty might reduce the burden of frequent dental pain at population level
